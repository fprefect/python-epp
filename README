==== EPP Reverse Proxy ====

Installation:
	Extract to /usr/local/epp or checkout from hg
	Copy init/epp-rproxy to /etc/init.d/
	Copy etc/epp-rproxy.conf to /etc/ and edit for your system
	Touch /etc/sysconfig/epp-rproxy

Usage:
	Use the init script to start and stop the service. For testing,
	it can also be run manually like this:

	env PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/epp" \
	  EPP_RPROXY_CONFIG="/usr/local/epp/etc/epp-rproxy.conf" \
	  twistd -noy bin/epp-rproxy.tac

Notes:
	Authentication is not required per connection. It probably
	wouldn't be that hard to implement though. This means that
	once a successful login has happened, new login will appear
	to succeed regardless of their clID or pw and commands will
	not be truely authenticated. Protect your proxy well. Or
	implement client auth comparison.
